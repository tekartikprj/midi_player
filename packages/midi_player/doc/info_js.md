Libao: An extremely minimalist C library for cross platform audio playback. It does the job, but the lack of options for buffer data types and the lack of an asynchronous interface may make it not ideal for some uses.
Libsndfile: A cross platform C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound.
PortAudio: A slightly more elaborate C library for cross platform audio playback. Has the variety of buffer data types and the asynchronous callback interface that libao lacks.
